To test my code, you can type make, and all code should be able to compile.

For the encode and decode, my idea is that we can add 0s at the end to make it mutiples of 8. Then, we can store numbers of zero we added at the beginning. When we decoded we will delete the extra zero at the end. My program will decode and cin at the same time.
